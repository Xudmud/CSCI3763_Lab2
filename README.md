# CSCI3763_Lab2
Lab 2 for Intro to Computer Networks: Socket Programming

This project is a work-in-progress, it will be updated as I complete more of it.  
The folder structure may change without warning, based on progress and requirements.

--Update 11 March 2019--
Client and Server will each need their own program, and are designed to run on
separate machines. Split them into their own folders to keep code separate.
