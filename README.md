This project is a work-in-progress, it will be updated as I complete more of it.  
The folder structure may change without warning, based on progress and requirements.  

--Update 11 March 2019--  
Client and Server will each need their own program, and are designed to run on  
separate machines. Split them into their own folders to keep code separate.
